# Configuring the Logging Application Block #
----------

This topic describes two alternative approaches to configuring the Logging Application Block. Programmatic configuration makes use of the **LoggingConfiguration** class to build the configuration in code; declarative configuration makes use of XML configuration files to define the configuration of the block. Typically, if you use declarative configuration, you also use the Enterprise Library Configuration Tool to edit the configuration file.  
The following topics describe the two different approaches to configuring the Logging Application Block in detail:  
+ [Using Programmatic Configuration](test-markdown_14086c0b-21bc-4307-b89e-890355f9aa8a.html)
+ [Using Declarative Configuration](test-markdown_0d425989-6830-4e25-9fcf-e4dc2db4501a.html)
For a general discussion of the various approaches to configuring Enterprise Library blocks, see the topic [Configuring Enterprise Library](test-markdown_05ae7aff-85e4-46b5-8401-c4df81a2ea00.html).
