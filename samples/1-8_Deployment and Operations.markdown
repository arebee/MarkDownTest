----------

For details of deploying and updating Enterprise Library and the application blocks, see <a href="test-markdown_10966b86-db1f-40de-95ff-b84e2cdfff20.html" xmlns:dt="uuid:C2F41010-65B3-11d1-A29F-00AA00C14882" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp">Deploying Enterprise Library</a>.
