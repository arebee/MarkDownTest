# Key Scenarios #
----------

This series of topics describes common situations developers must address when providing logging functionality in their applications. Each scenario explains the task, describes a real-world situation where such a task might arise, and includes code demonstrating how to use the Logging Application Block to complete the task. The scenarios are as follows:  
+ [Logging to a Database](test-markdown_b010d39c-5196-439a-8d7c-92d6cbe1d892.html). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to a database.
+ [Logging to Windows Event Log](test-markdown_45e42198-6a44-4d0b-bb55-691b7c5ed2bf.html). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to Windows Event Log.
+ [Logging to a Disk File](test-markdown_d0234cae-d49b-44b0-9f0c-bb79089022af.html). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to a disk file.
+ [Logging to Windows Message Queuing](test-markdown_7dd3bd7e-c463-4dbd-92f8-472e0eab8d53.html). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to Windows Message Queuing.
+ [Logging as E-mail Messages](test-markdown_c28f7cd6-7933-47ba-8d30-ac4ecaa96a52.html). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of sending logging information in e-mail messages.
+ [Logging Messages Asynchronously](test-markdown_cb1f81e5-c18e-4844-ba6e-3be859c2f947.html). This topic describes how you can write log messages asynchronously by using the built-in **AsynchronousTraceListenerWrapper** class.
+ [Populating and Raising Events from Code](test-markdown_3712145d-7fa5-4fd7-b9a7-ea2d018b5fc7.html). This scenario illustrates how to write code to specify the data to be logged, along with a category and priority, and pass it to the application block. 
+ [Populating a Log Message with Additional Context Information](test-markdown_62843eda-e525-4531-8d26-4efddd75ccef.html). This scenario illustrates how to populate a dictionary of custom information to be added to a log entry. 
+ [Tracing Activities and Propagating Context Information](test-markdown_76ae5d88-2ad5-4d53-a727-c8f80807d6d1.html). This scenario illustrates how to log the start and end of an activity and trace key activity points in between. 
+ [Checking Filter Status before Constructing Log Messages](test-markdown_37d65dcf-7447-46f6-97ec-6208b9a317b6.html). This scenario illustrates how to avoid collecting log information for messages that will not be logged according to the current configuration information.
