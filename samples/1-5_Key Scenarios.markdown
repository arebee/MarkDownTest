# Key Scenarios #
----------

This series of topics describes common situations developers must address when providing logging functionality in their applications. Each scenario explains the task, describes a real-world situation where such a task might arise, and includes code demonstrating how to use the Logging Application Block to complete the task. The scenarios are as follows:  
+ [Logging to a Database]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to a database.
+ [Logging to Windows Event Log]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to Windows Event Log.
+ [Logging to a Disk File]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to a disk file.
+ [Logging to Windows Message Queuing]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of logging to Windows Message Queuing.
+ [Logging as E-mail Messages]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes the process you should follow for using the Logging Application Block to implement the common requirement of sending logging information in e-mail messages.
+ [Logging Messages Asynchronously]({$finalDocSet}). This topic describes how you can write log messages asynchronously by using the built-in **AsynchronousTraceListenerWrapper** class.
+ [Populating and Raising Events from Code]({$finalDocSet}). This scenario illustrates how to write code to specify the data to be logged, along with a category and priority, and pass it to the application block. 
+ [Populating a Log Message with Additional Context Information]({$finalDocSet}). This scenario illustrates how to populate a dictionary of custom information to be added to a log entry. 
+ [Tracing Activities and Propagating Context Information]({$finalDocSet}). This scenario illustrates how to log the start and end of an activity and trace key activity points in between. 
+ [Checking Filter Status before Constructing Log Messages]({$finalDocSet}). This scenario illustrates how to avoid collecting log information for messages that will not be logged according to the current configuration information.
