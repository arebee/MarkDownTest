# Extending and Modifying the Logging Application Block #
----------

In its original state, the Logging Application Block works well for typical logging scenarios. However, there may be times when you need to customize some of the application block's behavior to better suit your application's particular requirements. There are two ways to do this: you can extend the Logging Application Block using the built-in extension points or you can modify the application block by making changes to its source code.
